# shr-sampler in GigPies: activation plan

Planning baseline **2026-10-04 / GP-2026-10-04.1**. All new tasks below are
**planned**, not implemented by this document. [Central inventory](https://github.com/PaolaShultz/gigpies/blob/main/docs/MODULE_IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md) ·
[Agreed contracts](https://github.com/PaolaShultz/gigpies/blob/main/docs/MODULE_CONTRACTS.md). Existing product roadmaps remain authoritative for
unrelated work; this plan owns only the GigPies integration increments below.

## Objective and boundary

Own prepared sample Engine and .shrinst/SFZ preparation. Keep decoding/import/filesystem work outside Engine::render_block. GigPies source/control desks do not parse packages or launch ConvertWithMoss.

## Source and evidence reviewed

Repository: `/home/shome/p/shr-sampler`. Inspected HEAD: `3aaabd50288a54e851618e1c464429a0dbab73eb`.
Clean at inspection; recheck before editing. This dated observation is not a future ownership claim.

Owning documents: README.md, docs/NATIVE_PACKAGE_FORMAT.md, SFZ_IMPORT_PROFILE.md, HOST_ARCHITECTURE.md, LIVE_PROCESS_CONTRACT.md.

Source inspected: `crates/shr-sampler-core/src/engine.rs::{Engine,render_block}`, core preparation modules, `crates/shr-sampler-cli/src`, LIVE_PROCESS_CONTRACT.md.

Implemented preloaded instrument renderer and headless exact-name host: two JACK outputs, one ALSA input, 1024-event queue and 256 events/period with deferral and overflow All Notes Off. DAW is the actual consumer; GigPies is not integrated.

These are source inspection and previously recorded results, not fresh builds or
physical acceptance. The planning session runs documentation checks only.

## Milestones and tasks

Optional later external instrument; not a core dependency. First useful milestone is intentionally deferred. Activate SAM-01 only with an explicit GigPies instrument consumer and accepted host/event/source contract, exact compatibility pin and cleared authored test material.

Task states are execution dependencies: READY has no missing software provider;
WAITING names its precise prerequisite; DEFERRED has an activation condition.
Source delivery and build reservation are additional launch prerequisites on a
peer. Every row has one owner, the repository named in its Owner column. A later
task starts only after the previous artifact is reviewed, never merely delivered.

| Task / priority / state | Owner | Work area, inputs and required artifact | Output and measurable acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| SAM-01 / P3 / DEFERRED | shr-sampler | Activate SAM-01 only with an explicit GigPies instrument consumer and accepted host/event/source contract, exact compatibility pin and cleared authored test material. Existing named source files only after activation; provider contract must be accepted first. | One bounded external-host compatibility harness: package preflight, exact stereo source identity, event overflow/release and shutdown. Preserve read-only import semantics. No private samples or new runtime parser/host framework. |

## Validation and failure behavior

After activation: `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo +1.97.1 test --locked --workspace --all-targets -j 1`, focused engine/host tests then full normal suite for shared changes; fmt, warning-denied Clippy, locked check/debug build at milestone per AGENTS. Historical audition matrices stay opt-in.

Refuse escaping/symlink/malformed packages before activation, no whole-take media copy; fixed voices and finite/no-allocation output. Wrong rate/host identity faults visibly; missing process cannot silently reconnect to an unrelated JACK client.

Historical research, auditions, exhaustive matrices, long soaks, full-show renders
and physical/combined-load checks are intentionally outside the normal software
milestones unless their protected behavior changes. Retain their owning documented
on-demand commands; no private media download or test hardware side effect.
Independent builds retain lockfiles and existing repository editions; this plan
does not upgrade dependencies/editions or replace existing intra-repository workspace
paths. The ban is on new sibling-repository path dependencies.

## Resources, review and recovery of work

No initial node/build reservation. On activation use a freed software lane with one jobs=1 build slot and exact reviewed source pin. Provisional first-harness budget ≤1 GiB compiler RSS and ≤512 MiB new output; native DSP builds need fresh inventory. No cache/media mirroring or background bench.

Independent fallback: none; leave deferred until a real consumer and scoped authorization exist. No unbounded render or research assignment.
Before builds check free space and target size; below 20 GiB free or above 5 GiB
output is a review, not permission to delete another task's cache. No reduced
coverage/debug information to make a budget appear to pass.

Handoff: exact changed files, commit plus patch hashes or bounded source manifest
if uncommitted, contract IDs/versions and provider-fixture hashes, commands/results,
intentional skipped classes, remaining limits and next task/owner. Stage only named
owned changes if a later implementation session commits; no public push is implied.
Receiving owner reviews independently and writes an immutable private-ledger
acknowledgement. Interrupted work stays visible with last completed acceptance
criterion; never reset/stash/clean another session or replay an uncertain mutation.

## Activation boundary

Activate SAM-01 only with an explicit GigPies instrument consumer and accepted host/event/source contract, exact compatibility pin and cleared authored test material. No runtime change or compatibility claim is made by writing this plan.

## Implementation launch prompt

Host/cwd assignments and source preparation are in GigPies PARALLEL_WORK_PLAN.md.
This is a prompt for a later user-started session; no implementation worker has
been started by the planning pass.

```text
Read docs/plans/GIGPIES_IMPLEMENTATION.md in shr-sampler, check current source and owning instructions,
and verify whether its activation condition is satisfied. There is no READY
implementation task for this repository in the initial GigPies wave. Do not
invent one. If still deferred, report that fact and stop. If activated by an
explicit later GigPies task, implement only the named bounded task after its
contract/ownership review; preserve other sessions and unrelated work. No sibling
writes, unilateral contract changes or sibling path dependencies. Use Rust 1.97.1,
Cargo.lock and CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 with the shared build slot and cargo -j 1;
respect any stricter owning build restriction. No physical audio/MIDI/DMX,
playback, devices, services, shared load, publication or deployment. Never mark
mocked/incomplete work done; report exact dependency mismatches and keep progress
in this plan. There is no busywork fallback; remain deferred.
```

## Progress

- 2026-10-04: source and owner documents inspected; plan written. Implementation
  tasks remain in the states above. Physical evidence retains its original limits.
